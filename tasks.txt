1. File Structure & links between files
2. Main Menu with functional Start Button, which
   - Hides Main Menu
   - "Display: Flex" game-screen
   - Console.log Vikings & Saxons hardcoded in the units file

**Prios for next time:**

- Game-screen layout (add background and arrange the divs)
- Create red and blue squares as placeholders for the Vikings & Saxons
- Code the fighting logic by which I can click on one to select, then click on the other to attack
- Code the death and deletion of the squares when health <= 0
- If time allows: create animations in which squares go to the selected target, stay there 2 seconds, and then go back.
